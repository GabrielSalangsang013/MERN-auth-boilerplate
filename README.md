# MERN with Authentication using JWT Boilerplate 

This is my boilerplate for building MERN Stack application monolithic architecture. Most application need authencation and building MERN stack starting with authentication is very hassle that's why I decided to create a ready made MERN stack with authentication.

Feel free to fork this project to improve the UI, structure, performance, and security of this application.
